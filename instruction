class Node {
	Rectangle rect;

	Set<Node> upNodes;
	Set<Node> downNodes;
	Set<Node> leftNodes;
	Set<Node> rightNodes;
}
Each node are connected to their nearest neighbor which intersect with them.
if multiple nearest neighbors are on the same distance then these node will be included in the set
Rectangle {
	x, y, width, height
}

A to Z are nodes

AAA means a.rect.width = 3 and a.rect.height = 1

 EEE
 EEE means e.rect.width = 3 and e.rect.height = 3

Using the example below write a program that connect all the nodes and set for each node the expected result
And traverse the graph from A to display all the Nodes
